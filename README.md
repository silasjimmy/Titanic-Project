# Titanic Project

## Introduction
The famous "unsinkable" Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg on April 15, 1912. At the time there weren't enough lifeboats for everyone on board resulting to the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

## Goal of the project
According to the story, rumors are that some groups of people were lucky to survive the shipwreck. The goal is to build a predictive model that predicts the sort of people who are likely to survive, using the data provided about the passengers.

## Dataset source
This project is part of the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview), a challenge aimed to introduce learners to Machine Learning. I've done more than building a predictive model; analysis and correction/replacement of missing values so to get an insight on the dataset.
